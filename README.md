# Galerkin Least-Squares Finite Element Method for the Incompressible Navier-Stokes Equations with FEniCS

Submitted as part of the MSc in Mathematical Modelling and Scientific Computing at the University of Oxford.

--------------------------

This repository accompanies the report "Galerkin Least-Squares Finite Element Method for the Incompressible Navier-Stokes Equations with FEniCS". Using the FEniCS software, I solved the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, using a Galerkin Least Squares stabilisation method, for the process of turning natural water into drinking water.

The file navierstokes.py needs the FEniCS project to be installed.

The .mov movies show the laminar and turbulent flows for the described application.
